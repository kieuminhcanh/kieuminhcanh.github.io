## 🔒 Privacy Policy for Typing Translate AI

### Last Updated: November 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Typing Translate AI** (the "Extension") handles information.

### 1. Data Collection

**Typing Translate AI does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, usage data, browsing history, or user input from its users.**

- The Extension operates solely within your web browser.
- Any text data processed for translation (which is your user input) is handled by the third-party translation service you are using (e.g., Google Translate API). We do not intercept, store, or log this content on any server controlled by the Extension's developer.
- The Extension does not use cookies, local storage, or any persistent identifiers to track users.

### 2. Permissions Used

The Extension requires minimal permissions necessary for its function:

- `activeTab` **or Host Permissions:** Required to access and interact with the content of the currently active tab (where the user is typing) in order to provide the translation interface.
- **Third-Party Services:** The Extension relies on external, Google Gemini to perform the translation function. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services.

### 3. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and the effective date will be updated. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

### 4. Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact <minhcanhdn0704@gmail.com> or via the Chrome Web Store listing page.
